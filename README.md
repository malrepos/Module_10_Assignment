# Module_10_Assignment

This is an unsupervised learning assignment.

There is a focus on producing optimal clusters of data, in this case cryptocurrency data.

Clusters are made using the KMeans algorithm.

Elbow curves are plotted in order to get the optimal value 'k' for the amount of clusters to use.

Given the number of features present in the data, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the features to 3, thereby producing clearer clusters and more understandable results.

## Libraries

The focus here is on using the sklearn library.

I use KMeans for clustering.

PCA for decomposition.

StandardScalar for preprocessing.
